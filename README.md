## Background

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Goals
* Import earthquake data from USGS API and visualize earthquake dataset
* Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.
* Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color
*  * Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
