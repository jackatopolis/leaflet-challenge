# Visualizing Earthquake Data with Leaflet

Published: https://jackatopolis.github.io/leaflet-challenge/

## Background

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data and to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet. 

## Details
* Import earthquake datasets from USGS API and visualize earthquake and tectonic plates
* Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.
* Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color
   * Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger
   * Earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color
* Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked
* Include satellite and topographic base maps
* Include toggleable earthquake and tectonic plate overlays on the map
